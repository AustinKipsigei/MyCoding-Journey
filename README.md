# MyCoding-Journey
Hello there,my name is Austin Kipsigei I'm going to show you my jorney into Data Engineering 
Before we get into that I would like you to know why I chose this field.
In today's world,a lot of things are data driven.Many systems rely on data.Data is raw and messy,
to combat that we create databases and analyse this data and use them to make important desicions to in businesses or even individualy.
In this journey I'll show you how I got to learn the necessary skills to mine data,pipeline it,choose an appropriate data structure,the appropriate tools to use like GitHub,The Command Line and Digital Ocean along side with essential skills like working with big data,cloud-based hosting
and data wrangling.
I will also learn the fundamental programming languages for this which include SQL,Python and PySpark

 PYTHON FUNDAMENTALS FOR DATA ENGINEERING
 
 Python is a broad language and is an in important langauage used in Data Engineering
     After this I should be able to do the following using Python:
        
        -Write Python programs
        -Use Python functions
        -Manage programs using control flow
        -Store data using Python lists
        -Iterate over lists of data using loops and list comprehensions
        -Manipulate strings in Python
        -Map data using Python dictionaries
        -Create your own data types with Python classes
        -Work with modules and files
        -Build Python projects that tackle real data



#Python101
Let's begin by learning Python              
  My first Program in Python is the "Helloworld",,,the code to that program is helloworld.py named above

<a href = "https://github.com/AustinKipsigei/MyCoding-Journey/blob/main/variables.py">variables</a>:Shows the use of variables in Pyhton

<a href = "https://github.com/AustinKipsigei/MyCoding-Journey/blob/main/concatenation.py">concatenation</a>:This is combining the contents of two strings

<a href = "https://github.com/AustinKipsigei/MyCoding-Journey/blob/main/lovelyseats.py">Lovely Seats</a>:showcases the use of variables and concatenation.

<a href = "https://github.com/AustinKipsigei/MyCoding-Journey/blob/main/Magic%208-ball.py">Magic 8-ball</a> 
program showcases the use of relational operatore and logical operators which is an important concept in Python.

<a href = "https://github.com/AustinKipsigei/MyCoding-Journey/blob/main/Sal's%20shipping.py">Sal's Shipping</a>: This program uses "if", "else" and "elif" statements and how to use them in Pyhton

<a href = "https://github.com/AustinKipsigei/MyCoding-Journey/blob/main/Physics%20class.py">Physics Class</a> : This program  shows the use of functions in python

<a href = "https://github.com/AustinKipsigei/MyCoding-Journey/blob/main/Len's%20slice.py">Len's</a>:This program demonstrates the use of lists in Python,which are important in storing data.

<a href = "https://github.com/AustinKipsigei/MyCoding-Journey/blob/main/threads.py">Threads</a>: This program manipulates strings in varous ways using methods such as .split(),.fomart()etc

<a href = "https://github.com/AustinKipsigei/MyCoding-Journey/blob/main/timetravelers_toolkit.py">Timetraveller's Toolkit</a> : This program shows how we can work with modules and files in Python

PYTHON PANDAS:
Pandas is a Python module for working with tabular data (i.e., data in a table with rows and columns). Tabular data has a lot of the same functionality as SQL or Excel, but Pandas adds the power of Python.
