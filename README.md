# MyCoding-Journey
Hello there,my name is Austin Kipsigei I'm going to show you my jorney into Data Engineering 
Before we get into that I would like you to know why I chose this field.
In today's world,a lot of things are data driven.Many systems rely on data.Data is raw and messy,
to combat that we create databases and analyse this data and use them to make important desicions to in businesses or even individualy.
In this journey I'll show you how I got to learn the necessary skills to mine data,pipeline it,choose an appropriate data structure,the appropriate tools to use like GitHub,The Command Line and Digital Ocean along side with essential skills like working with big data,cloud-based hosting
and data wrangling.
I will also learn the fundamental programming languages for this which include SQL,Python and PySpark
 
#Python101
Let's begin by learning Python              
  My first Program in Python is the "Helloworld",,,the code to that program is helloworld.py named above

  Variables:

  Next I learnt how to declare variables which is a way of storing values in Python
  Go to "Variables.py" to access the code on how to declare and use variables appropriately

Concatenation:This is combining the contents of two strings(concatenation.py)
lovelySeats.py
LovelySeats program showcases the use of variables and concatenation.
