# MyCoding-Journey
Hello there,my name is Austin Kipsigei I'm going to show you my jorney into coding 
Before we get into that I would like you to know why I chose this field.
In today's world,a lot of things are data driven.Many systems rely on data.Data is raw and messy,
to combat that we create databases and analyse this data and use them to make important desicions to in businesses or even individualy.
In this journey I'll show you how I got to learn the necessary skills to mine data,pipeline it,choose an appropriate data structure,the appropriate tools to use including Power Bi and create a database system.
I will also learn the fundamental programming languages for this which include SQL and Python.
